/**
 * This tool processes a nearley.js grammar with "generics", such as
 *
 *      Foo<T> -> Bar<T> Hao<T>
 *      Example -> Foo<x>
 *      Mua -> Foo<y>
 *
 * and expands all the generic templates:
 *
 *      Foo_x -> Bar_x Hao_x
 *      Foo_y -> Bar_y Hao_y
 *      Example -> Foo_x
 *      Mua -> Foo_y
 *
 * Foo<A> (uppercase) is treated as a generic rule with a variable "A", and
 * Foo<b> (lowercase) is treated as an instantiation thereof with A = b.
 *
 * It also processes C-style `#ifdef FLAG / #else / #endif` directives.
 *
 * It's not very fancy, and uses regex to get the job done. It expects rules to
 * be contained in one line and only refer to at most one generic variable.
